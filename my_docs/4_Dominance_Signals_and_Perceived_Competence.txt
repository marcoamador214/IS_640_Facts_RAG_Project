Title: Why Confidence Looks Like Competence

In social groups, confident people often gain influence—not because they’re right, but because they *seem* right. Studies show that body language, tone of voice, and decisiveness create an impression of competence. Anderson and Kilduff found that dominant personalities were often rated as more skilled, even when their actual task performance didn’t match the perception.

This “confidence halo” affects classrooms, offices, and politics. People who speak assertively are seen as leaders, while cautious speakers are seen as uncertain—even when they’re more accurate. In some historical cases, overconfident leaders made catastrophic calls: the Challenger disaster investigation found that NASA managers underestimated risks despite engineers’ warnings. Their confidence swayed decisions toward tragedy.

The lesson is simple but powerful: confidence *feels* like truth, but it’s not evidence. Effective decision-making requires separating how something is said from what is actually true.
