Title: How to Stay Confident—but Correct — The Power of Calibration

Being confident isn’t the problem—being wrong *and* confident is. That’s why “calibration training” was developed: a method to align confidence with accuracy. Participants make predictions and get feedback comparing confidence levels with actual results. Over time, they learn to express uncertainty more realistically.

Professionals who forecast markets, weather, or policy outcomes benefit from calibration practice. It teaches them to use probability ranges instead of absolute claims (“I’m 80% sure” vs. “I know this will happen”). Studies show that trained forecasters maintain both confidence and accuracy.

This approach turns humility into a measurable skill. When people acknowledge uncertainty, they make better long-term judgments. In a world where confidence often wins attention, true expertise lies in being precise about what we *don’t* know.
