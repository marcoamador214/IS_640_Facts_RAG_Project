Title: The “Pre-Mortem” — A Simple Trick to Catch Overconfidence Early

Organizations often suffer from overconfidence in planning—believing things will go right without asking what could go wrong. Psychologist Gary Klein proposed a tool called the “pre-mortem.” Instead of asking “What could fail?”, teams imagine their project *already failed* and work backward to find reasons why.

This mindset shift makes people more willing to voice doubts. It helps uncover hidden risks and assumptions. For example, some NASA teams and business firms now use pre-mortems to surface potential points of failure before committing major resources.

The method also empowers quieter team members who might otherwise defer to confident voices. By normalizing skepticism, it reduces the bias toward overconfident decision-making. It’s a structured way to balance optimism with realism—vital for complex projects or leadership decisions.
