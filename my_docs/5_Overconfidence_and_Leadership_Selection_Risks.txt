Title: When Overconfidence Wins Elections and Boardrooms

People often mistake confidence for leadership. Research shows that individuals who appear sure of themselves are more likely to be chosen as leaders, even when their competence is average. This is sometimes called the “charisma trap.”

Overconfident leaders can make risky decisions because they trust intuition over data. History offers vivid examples—from corporate failures like Enron to political leaders making hasty military choices under illusion of control. In these cases, confidence wasn’t just misplaced—it magnified the harm.

Interestingly, moderate confidence combined with self-awareness tends to predict the best outcomes. Leaders who question their own certainty often make more informed choices. Encouraging humility and dissent in teams helps avoid “groupthink,” where everyone agrees simply because a confident voice dominates.
